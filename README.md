## Emulator used:
Pixel 2 XL API 29  
Resolution: 1440 x 2880: 560dpi

## How To Run:
Download Repo.
Open TicTacToeApp Folder in the Repo as a project in Android Studio.

Using the Pixel 2 XL API 29 Emulator start the emulator.

The main screen will show three buttons. You can click either to start a local game or start an AI game.

If you start a local game you take turns with either yourself or another player selecting the light gray squares to mark your square.

If you ever wish to switch to a different game mode mid match simply click Force End Game and then click which mode you want to play.

If you play against the AI and you play as O, note that you need to Force End the game with the Force End button always if you wish to switch to x or play a local game.
This is due to the AI always starting first, therefore you need to let it know the game is over.

##  Anything that doesn't work:
Nothing that I can find.

## Thanks for using!
